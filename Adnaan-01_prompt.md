## Prompt

You are a philosopher and ethicist who specializes in analyzing moral dilemmas. I want you to examine the following scenario in detail and provide a balanced view of different ethical perspectives:

**Scenario**: A hospital has a limited supply of life-saving medicine that can only help one patient. Two patients need it urgently:
1. An elderly patient, aged 80, who has dedicated their life to teaching and mentoring.  
2. A young student, aged 19, who shows great potential in scientific research.

### Requirements for Your Analysis

1. **Utilitarian Perspective**: Evaluate which choice leads to the greatest overall good for the most people.  
2. **Deontological Perspective**: Discuss any moral duties or principles involved, regardless of outcomes.  
3. **Virtue Ethics**: Reflect on the character traits and intentions behind choosing one patient over the other.  
4. **Personal Recommendation**: Offer a conclusion that balances these viewpoints.  
5. **Counterarguments**: Briefly explore at least one counterargument to your recommendation and address it.

# Ethical Dilemma Analysis

Let's explore this dilemma from three main moral theories—**utilitarianism**, **deontology**, and **virtue ethics**—then I'll provide a recommendation and acknowledge a counterargument.

---

## 1. Utilitarian Perspective

Under utilitarianism, the key question is: **Which action brings about the greatest happiness or benefit for the largest number of people?**

- **Elderly Patient**: They have already contributed significantly to society by teaching and mentoring. Saving them could allow them to continue sharing their wisdom with others, but their life expectancy may be shorter.  
- **Young Student**: They have many years ahead, which could result in future contributions to science or society. If saved, their potential long-term impact might benefit more people in the future.

From a utilitarian angle, saving the younger patient might yield greater benefits to society over time, because this person's potential is still unfolding.

---

## 2. Deontological Perspective

Deontology focuses on **moral duties and principles** rather than the outcome.

- One might argue we have a **duty to preserve life** whenever possible, without discrimination based on age or potential.  
- Another duty could be **fairness**: we should avoid valuing one life more highly than another simply due to future prospects.

A strict deontologist could say there is no moral rule that justifies prioritizing one life over another based on age or potential, so they might advocate a random selection method to remain fair and uphold the duty to treat all lives equally.

## 3. Virtue Ethics

Virtue ethics examines the character traits and motivations behind actions:

- **Compassion**: We want to act out of concern for both patients.  
- **Justice**: We strive to be fair and impartial, possibly involving a lottery system if there is no clear moral reason to favor one over the other.  
- **Practical Wisdom (Prudence)**: Considering the broader context, including likely benefits each patient can still bring to the community.

A virtuous decision-maker aims to be compassionate while also using wisdom to foresee consequences. This could lead one to save the younger patient (due to potential future contributions) or to remain neutral by applying a fair selection method.

---

## 4. Personal Recommendation

Balancing these viewpoints:

- **Utilitarian** reasoning leans toward saving the younger patient for long-term societal benefit.  
- **Deontological** reasoning might suggest an equal chance for both.  
- **Virtue Ethics** encourages compassion and practicality.

**Recommendation**: A balanced position might incorporate respect for life and a fair process. If forced to decide, I might slightly lean toward saving the younger patient, acknowledging future societal contributions. However, I would also ensure transparent and fair criteria to avoid devaluing the elderly patient's life and contributions.

---

## 5. Counterargument

**Counterargument**: The elderly patient's lifetime of contributions and mentorship might argue they have earned priority in receiving medical help.  
**Response**: Indeed, their service is invaluable. Yet, from a societal perspective, it's important to consider the potential years of life and future impact. This doesn't negate the respect owed to elders, but it recognizes a broader social benefit dimension.

---

**In conclusion**, this ethical dilemma highlights the tension between outcome-based thinking, duty-based principles, and character-driven approaches. By acknowledging these perspectives, we gain a deeper understanding of the moral complexities involved, even if the final decision remains challenging.
