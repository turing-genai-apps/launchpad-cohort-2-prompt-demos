## Prompt

Given the domain: "Data Structure Manipulation", generate 40 unique problem categories that are novel and do not reference any specific named algorithm or commonly known technique.

### Task Levels Definition:
- Level 1: A simple category an average programmer fluent in the language can understand in 5 minutes.
- Level 2: A category that involves basic operations, suitable for a beginner to explore in an hour.
- Level 3: A category that requires an understanding of fundamental concepts and could take a few hours to grasp fully.
- Level 4: A moderately complex category that involves non-trivial problem-solving, requiring deeper thought and a day of study.
- Level 5: An advanced category requiring deep domain-specific knowledge or innovative problem-solving, suitable for week-long exploration.

### Requirements:
- Do not reference specific named algorithms, theorems, or well-known coding challenges.
- Focus on concepts and categories rather than solutions.
- Concise descriptions: 4-5 words that clearly define the category.
- Unique and relevant to the given domain while avoiding redundancy.
- Accessible: No highly technical jargon or unnecessary complexity.
- Well-defined: Each category should be structured enough to inspire multiple problems within it.



### Example Output:

## LLM Response

Sure! Here's a list of **40 novel and unique problem categories** under the domain **"Data Structure Manipulation"**, spread across 5 difficulty levels. Each category is abstract and creative enough to inspire multiple problem ideas while **avoiding references to named algorithms** or **overused challenges**.

```json
{
  "L1": [
    "Count Repeated Elements",
    "Track Min and Max",
    "Reverse List Segments",
    "Find Unique Characters",
    "Replace Elements by Index",
    "Group Elements by Parity",
    "Filter Odd-Indexed Items",
    "Compare Two Sequences"
  ],
  "L2": [
    "Rotate Segments in Arrays",
    "Track Sequence of Updates",
    "Mirror Data Structures",
    "Condense Consecutive Entries",
    "Alternate Insertion Strategies",
    "Find Balanced Distributions",
    "Trace Nested Containers",
    "Collapse Redundant Entries"
  ],
  "L3": [
    "Shift Windows Over Structure",
    "Map Connections Dynamically",
    "Synchronize Parallel Sequences",
    "Construct Interleaved Outputs",
    "Flatten Mixed Hierarchies",
    "Manage Cyclic References",
    "Simulate Limited Memory Behavior",
    "Evaluate Condition-Based Traversals"
  ],
  "L4": [
    "Design Reversible Transformations",
    "Rebuild Structure from Traces",
    "Split Structures by Rule Sets",
    "Index Arbitrary Depth Levels",
    "Balance Competing Substructures",
    "Compact Structures for Efficiency",
    "Track Temporal State Changes",
    "Partition Based on Constraints"
  ],
  "L5": [
    "Derive Minimal Representations",
    "Evolve Self-Adjusting Structures",
    "Route Data Through Layers",
    "Optimize Cross-linked Structures",
    "Generate Predictive Rearrangements",
    "Create Data-Driven Heuristics",
    "Model Dynamic Access Patterns",
    "Synchronize Multi-level Structures"
  ]
}
```

Let me know if you'd like example problems inspired by any of these categories or want them adapted for a specific data structure like trees, graphs, or custom types.
